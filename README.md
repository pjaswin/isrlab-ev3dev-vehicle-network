# Lego Mindstorms EV3 Autonomous Vehicle Network

The project is for implementing a self-driving vehicular network using Lego Mindstorms EV3.

## Repository Contents
- [ISRLAB - Lego Mindstorms EV3 Autonomous Vehicle Network](ISRLAB%20Project%20Report.pdf): Project Report
## Source Code
Each of the following directories contains the source code:
- [src/Simulation](src/Simulation): Simulation  
- [src/av_1](src/av_1): Normal Vehicle One
- [src/av_2](src/av_2): Normal Vehicle Two
- [src/av_emerg](src/av_emerg): Emergency Vehicle
- [src/pc_server](src/pc_server): Main Server
- [src/ev3_pc_client](src/ev3_pc_client): PC Client to simulate the third vehicle/Admin



The source codes in ev3_av_1 and ev3_emergency_vehicle are to be executed in the Lego Mindtorms EV3 devices after [installing](https://pybricks.com/install/mindstorms-ev3/installation/) Pybrick on it. The ev3_pc_server needs to be run on a linux environment.
